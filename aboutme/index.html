    <p>Hey Guys! I look foward to meeting you all and getting to know 
        you more throughout this course. </p>
    <p>I am currently studying data science with a minor in finance.</p>
    <p>I enjoy watching TV. Two shows imparticular are Seinfeld and 
        Survivor.</p>
    <p>I think that this class will be useful to know. I am not sure how 
        much of html and css I will end up using in a data science 
        career, but having a basic understanding of the methods behind 
        it will be helpful for me.</p>
