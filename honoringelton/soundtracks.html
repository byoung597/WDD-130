                Since his work with The Lion King, Elton has been involved in numerous more soundtracks, including one for his own biopic which released in 2019.
                Some of his other work included that of "The Road to El Dorado", "Gnomeo and Juliet", and "Billy Eliot" the musical.
                The Road to El Dorado featured many orignial songs by teh composer and even featured a colaboration between Elton and famous film composer Randy Newman, known for his work in Toy Story.
                Gnomeo and Juliet which was released in 2011, was a showcase of some of John's greatest hits used to tell the famous story of Romeo and Juliet. 
                John, the film's exetuve producer even included two original songs written alongside his friend/ lyricist Bernie Taupin. 
                The movie's soundtrack was recorded in Abbey Road Studios, made famous by the Beatles in the late 60's.4

                In 1994, Elton colaborated with Tim Rice to produce one of the greastest soundtracks of all time, Disney's The Lion King.
                By the turn of the century, John's work would pay off as The Lion King had sold over 15 million copies by that time.1
                Eventually, the movie was adapted into a broadway musical which to this day still stands as the highest grossing musical to date.
                Elton John returned to sing a song for the closing credits of The Lion King's live action remake in 2019.2

                Some of the most notable and popular songs from The Lion King are "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" and "The Circle of Life". 
                A survey was conducted in 2020 which determined that couples who chose "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" as the song for their first dance had a higher likelyhood of staying together than other popular songs, with about 77% of those couples having remained together over the years.3
