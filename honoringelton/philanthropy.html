            <h2>The Elton John Aids Foundation</h2>
            <p>
                John colaborated with fellow artists, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder in 1985 to record the song "That's What Friends Are For".
                All profits for the song were then used to raise awareness about the killer diseases HIV and AIDS.
            </p>
            <p>  
                In 1992, Elton John lost two aquaintances to aids, sparking him to create The Elton John Aids Foundation, and organization which has raised over 600 million dollars of the years in order to prevent the early loss of lives affected by aids.
                Funds from his organization are used to research the disease as well, to not only prevent the further spread of it, but to eliminate it entirely.1

            <p>
                The list of causes which Elton has decided to support over the course of his career is quite extensive.
                Some of the most prominant causes on the list include Abuse, Depression and Suicide, LGBTQ Support, Bullying, and Adoption/ Fostering.2
                Elton does not just support these causes but he is known for living what he believes. 
                Elton is married to his husband David Furnish. 
                In the past couple of years their family has grown to include their two sons Zachary and Elijah.
